# Week1--InClassExercise4_Coin-tossing

Here you are asked the following questions:

Suppose we simulate a sequence of 500 coin tosses. Define a ‘run’ as a sequence of all Heads (and of all Tails). Answer the following:
* What is the distribution of the number of heads?
* What is the distribution of the length of the run starting at the first toss?
* What is the expected number and distribution of the number of runs in total?
* What is the expected value and distribution of the length of the longest run?

I claim that if you did PM522a, or some other prob. course, you know the answers to some of those questions without needing to simulate. But, for at least one of them, simulation is probably the easiest approach.

I have uploaded a bit of working code that addresses these problems, 
but which seems to have a bug in it (toward the end). 
Do you get the same answers, and can you find the bug.
